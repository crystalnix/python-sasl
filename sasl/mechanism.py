"""mechanism.py -- SASL mechanism registry

A mechanism is a SASL authentication method.  Mechanisms are
registered with IANA.  This module defines an abstract interface and
registry for mechanisms implemented elsewhere in this package.

Mechanisms may be implemented by subclassing Mechanism or by using the
defined() class decorator.  In either case, the name of the class will
be registered by converting its name into a canonical form.
